Staticcheck is a tool for statically checking the inputs to and uses
of certain functions and constructs, such as `regexp.Compile`.


## Installation

Staticcheck requires Go 1.6 or later.

    go get honnef.co/go/staticcheck/cmd/staticcheck

## Usage

Invoke `staticcheck` with one or more filenames, a directory, or a package named
by its import path. Staticcheck uses the same
[import path syntax](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Import_path_syntax) as
the `go` command and therefore
also supports relative import paths like `./...`. Additionally the `...`
wildcard can be used as suffix on relative and absolute file paths to recurse
into them.

The output of this tool is a list of suggestions in Vim quickfix format,
which is accepted by lots of different editors.

## Purpose

Staticcheck checks the input to functions like `regexp.Compile` and
time.Parse and makes sure that they conform to the API contract. It
does so by finding function calls with constant inputs and then
evaluating these inputs in the same way the code would at runtime.

For example, for `regexp.Compile("foo(")`, staticcheck will find the
call to `regexp.Compile` and check if `foo(` is a valid regexp.

Furthermore, it checks that functions and constructs are used in the
correct way. It checks, for example, that sync.WaitGroup.Add is called
outside of a goroutine, to avoid race conditions.

The main purpose of staticcheck is editor integration, or workflow
integration in general. For example, by running staticcheck when
saving a file, one can quickly catch simple bugs without having to run
the whole test suite or the program itself.

The tool shouldn't report any errors unless there are legitimate
bugs - or very dubious constructs - in the code.

It is similar in nature to `go vet`, but has more checks that catch
bugs that would also be caught easily at runtime, to reduce the number
of edit, compile and debug cycles.

## Checks

The following things are currently checked by staticcheck:

- `regexp.Compile` and `regexp.MustCompile` - Checks that the regexp
  is valid
- `time.Parse` - Checks that the time format is valid
- `encoding/binary.Write` - Checks that the written value is supported
  by `encoding/binary`
- `text/template.Template.Parse` and `html/template.Template.Parse` –
  Check that the template is syntactically valid
- `net/url.Parse` - Checks that the URL is valid
- `time.Sleep` - Checks that the call doesn't use suspiciously small
  (<120), untyped literals. This usually indicates a bug, where
  `time.Sleep(1)` is assumed to sleep for 1 second, while in reality
  it sleeps for 1 nanosecond.
- `sync.WaitGroup.Add` – Checks that the method is called before
  launching the goroutine, to avoid a race condition.
- `sync.WaitGroup` - Checks that wait groups aren't copied when being
  passed to functions.
- `TestMain` - checks that the TestMain function calls os.Exit to
  report test failure. -- This check may have false positive. Its
  confidence is 0.9 and can be filtered with the `-min_confidence`
  flag set to `1`.
- `exec.Command` - checks that the first argument looks valid
- Dont use an empty `for {}` as it will spin.
- Don't have an empty `default` branch in a `select` in a loop as it
  will spin.
- Don't use `defer` in a loop that will never finish.
- Checks that two operands of a binary expression aren't identical.
  This is a common mistake when copy & pasting code. Example: `if x[0]
  == 1 || x[0] == 1` checks the same index of x twice and probably
  meant to check two different indices. When the operand contains a
  function call, the confidence will be 0.9, otherwise it will be 1.
- Checks that break statements aren't missing labels when trying to
  break out of a loop from inside a switch or select statement.
- Don't use printf-style functions to print dynamic strings with no
  formatting directives. For example, `fmt.Printf(fn())` will produce
  unexpected results if `fn` returns `"%s"`.
- Don't `defer rc.Close()` before having checked the error returned by
  `Open` or similar.
- Checks for empty critical sections, e.g. `(*sync.Mutex).Lock`
  directly followed by `(*sync.Mutex).Unlock`. This usually indicates
  a missing `defer`, or otherwise questionable code.
- Ineffective use of `&*x` or `*&y` when x is of type `*T` and y is
  of type `T`.
